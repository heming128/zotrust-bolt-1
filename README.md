## ðŸš¨ EthereumAddress Type Error Fix

If you encounter `EthereumAddress` type not found errors, follow these steps:

### 1. Clean Project Cache
```bash
flutter clean
```

### 2. Remove Pub Cache (if needed)
```bash
flutter pub cache clean
```

### 3. Reinstall Dependencies
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 4. Restart IDE/Analysis Server
- **VS Code**: `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` â†’ "Dart: Restart Analysis Server"
- **Android Studio**: `File â†’ Invalidate Caches â†’ Invalidate and Restart`

### 5. Verify Installation
Run this command to check if web3dart is properly installed:
```bash
flutter pub deps
```

Look for `web3dart 3.0.1` in the dependency tree.

### 6. Alternative Fix (if above doesn't work)
If the issue persists, temporarily downgrade to a stable version:
```yaml
# In pubspec.yaml, temporarily change:
web3dart: ^2.7.3  # Instead of ^3.0.1
```

Then run:
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter pub upgrade web3dart
```

### 7. Verify Fix
After running the above commands, the following imports should work without errors:
```dart
import 'package:web3dart/web3dart.dart';

// These should now be available:
EthereumAddress address = EthereumAddress.fromHex('0x...');
Web3Client client = Web3Client('rpc_url', http.Client());
```

## Technical Details

The error occurs because:
- The Dart analyzer cannot find the `EthereumAddress` class from web3dart package
- Package cache is outdated or corrupted
- IDE analysis server needs refreshing
- Dependency resolution conflicts

The `web3dart: ^3.0.1` package is valid and includes all required classes including `EthereumAddress`, `Web3Client`, `ContractAbi`, and `DeployedContract`.

## Affected Files
- `lib/core/services/web3_wallet_service.dart`
- `lib/core/services/zotrust_smart_contract_service.dart`

Both files properly import `package:web3dart/web3dart.dart` and should work correctly after following the fix steps above.
